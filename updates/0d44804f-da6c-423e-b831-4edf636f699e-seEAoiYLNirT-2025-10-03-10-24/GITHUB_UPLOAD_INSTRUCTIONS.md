# üì§ Upload Website Files to Your GitHub Repo

Your GitHub Repo: **https://github.com/cmiecz/GarageVault.git**

Since you're in Vibecode's environment, here's how to get the website files into your GitHub repo:

## Option 1: Upload via GitHub Web Interface (EASIEST - 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Download Files from Vibecode
You need to download these 4 files from your Vibecode workspace:
- `website/index.html`
- `website/privacy.html`
- `website/terms.html`
- `website/README.md`

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/cmiecz/GarageVault
2. Click "Add file" ‚Üí "Create new file"
3. In the filename box, type: `website/index.html`
   - The `website/` creates the folder automatically
4. Copy and paste the contents of `website/index.html` into the editor
5. Scroll down and click "Commit new file"
6. Repeat steps 2-5 for:
   - `website/privacy.html`
   - `website/terms.html`
   - `website/README.md`

‚úÖ **Done!** Your website folder is now in GitHub.

# Copy the 4 files from Vibecode to this folder
# (You'll need to download them first)

# Add and commit
git add website/
git commit -m "Add legal pages for App Store submission"
git push origin main
```
